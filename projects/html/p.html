    <p>A paragraph is a unit of writing in a larger body of work. A paragraph expresses a particular topic or theme.</p>
    <p>A paragraph is a component of fictional prose and non-fiction writings.

        When writing essays, research papers, books, etc., new paragraphs are indented to show their beginnings. Each new paragraph begins with a new indentation.
        
        The purpose of a paragraph is to express a speaker’s thoughts on a particular point in a clear way that is unique and specific to that paragraph. In other words, paragraphs shouldn’t be mixing thoughts or ideas. When a new idea is introduced, generally, a writer will introduce a new paragraph</p>
